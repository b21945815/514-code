1 - Missing Count + Ground truth is also wrong - Ground truth is checking how many of them has loan but should be checking which ones are eligible
2 - Ground truth is wrong - The database schema does not contain information about average salary by gender. The 'district' table only contains overall average salary data, not gender-specific data.
3 - Half answered + Ground truth is also wrong - It uses MIN(A11) without filtering female and others
4 - Filter order is wrong + Ground truth is also wrong - highest average salary part is missing
5 - SQL design is wrong - Sub select parameter count is wrong
6 - SQL logic is wrong - Adding info about district_id columns can help
7 - Ground truth is wrong - !!!!! Date filter is wrong in ground truth sql
8 - VectorDB result is wrong
9 - SQL logic is wrong
10 - JSON output wrong
11 - JSON output wrong
12 - JSON output wrong
13 - SQL logic is wrong
14 - JSON output wrong
15 - VectorDB result is wrong
16 - SQL logic is wrong
